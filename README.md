<h2>What is a Data Structure?<h2>
Data Structure is a way to organized data in such a way that it can be used efficiently. Following terms are foundation terms of a data structure.
<br>
  <b>Interface</b> − Each data strucure has an interface. Interface represents the set of operations that a datastructure supports.An interface only provides the list of supported operations, type of parameters they can accept and return type of these operations.
<br>
  <b>Implementation </b>− Implementation provides the internal representation of a data structure. Implementation also provides the defination of the alogrithms used in the opreations of the data structure.
<br>
  <h2>Characteristics of a Data Structure</h2>
  <br>
  <pre>
Correctness − Data Structure implementation should implement its interface correctly.

Time Complexity − Running time or execution time of operations of data structure must be as small as possible.

Space Complexity − Memory usage of a data structure operation should be as little as possible.
</pre>
  <br>
  <h2>Need for Data Structure</h2>
  <br>
  <pre>


Data Search − Consider an inventory of 1 million(106) items of a store. If application is to search an item. It has to search item in 1 million(106) items every time slowing down the search. As data grows, search will become slower.

Processor speed − Processor speed although being very high, falls limited if data grows to billon records.

Multiple requests − As thousands of users can search data simultaneously on a web server,even very fast server fails while searching the data.

</pre>

       <h2>Execution Time Cases</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
There are three cases which are usual used to compare various data structure's execution time in relative manner.
  </p>
  <br>
  <pre>
Worst Case − This is the scenario where a particular data structure operation takes maximum time it can take. If a operation's worst case time is ƒ(n) then this operation will not take time more than ƒ(n) time where ƒ(n) represents function of n.

Average Case − This is the scenario depicting the average execution time of an operation of a data structure. If a operation takes ƒ(n) time in execution then m operations will take mƒ(n) time.

Best Case − This is the scenario depicting the least possible execution time of an operation of a data structure. If a operation takes ƒ(n) time in execution then actual operation may take time as random number which would be maximum as ƒ(n).

<h2>Flowcharts and pseudocode<h2>
<p>How do you represent an algorithm? Writing code before fully understanding its underlying algorithm can lead to bugs, so what's a better alternative? Two options are flowcharts and pseudocode.
<br>
 <b> Using flowcharts to represent algorithms</b>
A flowchart is a visual representation of an algorithm's control flow. This representation illustrates statements that need to be executed, decisions that need to be made, logic flow (for iteration and other purposes), and terminals that indicate start and end points. Figure 1 reveals the various symbols that flowcharts use to visualize algorithms.</p>
  <pre>
A flowchart's simplicity and its ability to present an algorithm's control flow visually (so that it's is easy to follow) are its major advantages. Flowcharts also have several disadvantages, however:

It's easy to introduce errors or inaccuracies into highly-detailed flowcharts because of the tedium associated with drawing them.
It takes time to position, label, and connect a flowchart's symbols, even using tools to speed up this process. This delay might slow your understanding of an algorithm.
Flowcharts belong to the structured programming era and aren't as useful in an object-oriented context. In contrast, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is more appropriate for creating object-oriented visual representations.
